Note when building DemoOPL help

The constants INTERMEDIATEDIR and EXPORTEDHELPFILEHRH in the BldDemoHlp.mk need to be relative to the folder where the BldDemoHelp.mk is located.
Since the makefile is in the folder D:\Projects\OPL1.55\Opl\DemoOPL\group on my machine, the current path in BldDemoHelp.mk for these constants is 
..\..\..\..\..\Symbian6.0\NokiaCPP\... etc.
