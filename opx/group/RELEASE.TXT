Revision history
****************

release 006
===========
General
-------

New "MNT INSTSDK" now builds the directories/files needed for the OPL ER5 SDK. 

Added the following OPXs: Alarm, Buffer, Message, Music, Data(OPLDB), 
Spell, Subst.

Names of some of the OPXs needed changing to strip them of their prefix.  
This also required new UIDs for them.  The ones affected were:

			Old Uid     New UID
	Alarm	10000d3c	10004ec8
	Buffer  10000d3b	10004ec9
    Data    10000d3a	10004ec7
    Subst   10000d39    10004eca

Changed dependancies.

Emulator now includes Agenda for testing the AGNOPX.

CONTACT
-------
Uids and VcardMap order changed to match documentation.

Test code changed to reflect review comments.

SCOMMS
------
Changes to reflect latest version in OPXER3.

SYSRAM1
-------
Upped the minor version number.  Now 1.01 rather than 1.00

SYSINFO
-------
Test code changes, so that it will pass when the emulator has been freshly 
rebuilt.


release 005
===========
General
-------
Added dbutils to the group. This is used to fix a change in DBMS for ER5 which 
requires a view to be refreshed after changes.

Dependancies updated.

Getcomps now gets OPLTRAN.

EBLD INSTALL ALL now converts and moves test programs to C:\OPXTest on the emulator.

Contact
-------
Changes to behaviour of contact OPX to reflect API improvements identified whilst
writing docs for the ER5 SDK.  Behaviour is now as described in the docs.

Procedure ordinals changed.

VCard mapping CONSTS added to OXH.

Sysinfo
-------
Updated to fix bugs when running on ER5.

OwnerInfo now uses Richtext object rather than hacking a value out of the 
shell.ini stream.

consts defined.

Test code written to test procedures that have been updated.
