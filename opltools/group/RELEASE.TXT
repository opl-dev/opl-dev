OPLTOOLS

Changes:
 Added a workround for [1206638] Unable to build OPLTRAN with Nokia 7710 SDK.
 The workround is to use a version of OPLTRAN from another OPL developer 
 kit. e.g 9210, 9500.
 Note: each version of the developers kit contains its own OPLTRAN. As the 
 translator is identical for all versions, any working OPLTRAN.EXE can be 
 used with any other version.
 However, there is one problem: the EPOCROOT value is not used to create 
 the OPL .APP filename when translating an OPL APP, so OPL apps would end
 up in the wrong place. This change fixes that problem by adding a new 
 command line argument "-epocroot%EPOCROOT%" to allow the opltran batch file
 to pass the epocroot value to the tool.
 [Unable to use the Windows getenv("EPOCROOT") function, as it always 
 returned NULL.]
 To prepare a working OPLTRAN.EXE tool for central (remote) use, 
 assuming d:\rtools\ is your tools folder in your PATH.
 0. build/install OPLTRAN.EXE.
 1. mkdir d:\rtools\opltran\ folder.
 2. copy \epoc32\release\winc\udeb\ contents to opltran\ including subfolders.
 3. copy \epoc32\release\wins\udeb\z\system\data\eikcore.rsc resource file 
     to opltran\z\system\data\ folder.
 4. copy opltran-remote.bat file to d:\rtools\opltran.bat.
 5. modify that opltran.bat file so that it uses d:\rtools\opltran\opltran.exe

Changes:
 PhilS: Added in HRH2OPH to convert UIQ help compiler HRH files to OPH include files

209 (released as v1.22 by Rick, 26/05/2003)
Changes:
 Fixed bug 743653 allowing OPLTRAN to handle relative paths.

208 (released as 140887 by Rick, 20/12/2001)
Changes:
 Fixed OPLTRAN failing with file extensions longer than 3 characters

 Changed all _L() to _LIT()

207 (released as 115660 by Rick, 23/08/2001)
Changes:
 Added TSG/OSG (resource file output) as knwon types to convert between

 Added RSG2OSG folder and files - this is a BAT and small Perl script
 which will take an RSG file from the resource compiler, parse it to
 replace "#define " with "CONST " and also "0x" with "=&", save the new
 file with a TSG extension and then send that TSG to OPLTRAN to convert
 to an OSG for inclusion in OPL programs [the BAT and .PL are listed
 under PRJ_EXPORTS too]

206 (released as ????? by Rick, 24 July 00)
Changes:
 Use NearestLanguageFile() to pick up .R01 files in place of RSC.

205 (released as 41656 by Rick, 19 May 00)
 Changes to support EPOCROOT envvar for "Emulation Enhancements" work.

204 (released as 27340 by Rick, 31 March 00)
Changes:
 Moved target location of OPL APP files from ROM (Z:) to C:\System to fix 
 defect EDNPSPR-4HDMXR "Change OPLTran output location for APP files"
 Removed old PVCS stuff.

*** REMEMBER TO USE 'MAKMAKE OPLTRAN VC5WINC' ***

OPLTOOLS 201
============
* Switched from oplr resource file to opltran's own. This prevents a cyclic
  build dependancy [opltran needs oplt and oplr which needs opltran...]
  Note: any changes to the OPLR resource file need to be reflected here.

OPLTOOLS 200
============
(Released by Steve 15 Sept 99)
Uses: Crystal
Changes:
* Fixed the bug where the floppy drive was being scanned by changing Charconv calls to 
ConvertFromUnicodeToNative16Bit() etc.
* Unicode batch file is now OPLTRAN.BAT rather than OPLTRANU.BAT since builds only have to 
support unicode from now on.
* Removed a couple of build warnings (new build chain).
* Cmdline switches may now be delimited by either "-" or "/" and are case insensitive.

 **************************************************************************************
 ********** //!!TODO NEED TO MOVE CHARCONV.DLL INTO \RELEASE\WINC\UDEB MANUALLY
 ********** Ditto: etext.dll, field.dll, oplt.dll
 ********** Until such time as the relevant components build for WINC
 **************************************************************************************

OPLTOOLS 150
============
(Released by Rick 05 July 99)
Uses: ER5u dependencies
 Moved to new ETEXT (new line delim character breaks all existing Unicode EPOC OPL source files).
 Moved from Eikon to Uikon.
 Tidied code by removing unused portions for OPLT CONSOLE use.
 Stopped releasing narrow OPLTRAN.

OPLTOOLS 100
============
(Released by Rick 23 January 99)
Uses: ER5 dependencies.
Based on 003, but for ER5.
Uses ebld and mnt valid.
Added -s option, for 'silent' -- only errors are reported on the command line, successful translations
are not reported.
Removed -convU option as the Unicode opltran now imports ASCII text.
Added Unicode release of opltran. The opltranu.bat file handles the unicode version.

OPLTOOLS 003
============
(Released by Rick 19 Oct 98)
Uses: ER3 dependencies as before.

Added convertor functionality, supporting:
 -conv  Convert between ASCII and EPOC, and back
 -convU Convert between ASCII and Unicode EPOC, and back.

Note that there is no Unicode release of Opltran yet.

Version 1.00.002
================
(Released by RickA 30 June 98)
Uses: Platform 003 releases as before.

Changes to fix the following bugs:
1) EPOC Software Problems SW1-113 "Opltran can't handle errors in large 
   ASCII opl files."
2) EPCO Software Problems SW1-114 "Opltran uses incorrect output directory 
   with multiple files"

And rebadged copyright line to "Symbian Ltd".

Version 1.00.001
================
(Released by RickA on 10 June 98)
Uses: Platform 003 releases as before.

Based on previous version of OPLTRAN except the source has moved from the OPLT
group to a new group: OPLTOOLS.

Added testcode - tests available via MNT.CMD - all tests run correctly.

Created OPLTRAN.MMP, and added EBLD.BAT which is a bit sparse (+ will need 
more work esp. when other tools are added to the group).

Version 0.01.041
================
(Released by RickA on 07 April 98)
Uses: Platform 003 releases as before.

Identical to 038 except that the WINC translator tool now 

* has error format to match ODE (use new command line option -e to use alternate
  error output as per MS Dev etc)
* can recognise native EPOC32-format files as well as ASCII format.
* checks \Epoc32\Winc\Opl directory for include header files.
* returns an errorlevel of -1 if a translation error was found.

Version 0.01.040
================
(Released by RickA on 5 March 98)
Uses: Platform 003 releases as before.

Identical to 038 except that the WINC translator tool now reads the current Windows working directory which is used as a default for OPL file locations.
Also, the translator error output is produced using Windows printf() which allows development tools/editors to pick up the source file and position the cursor at the error; or it can redirected to an error file etc.

Added an undocumented debug command line argument "-v" that gives verbose feedback as the command line is parsed, showing the input and output paths that will be used etc.

NB. Edit \epoc32\tools\opltran.bat and change the drive from c: if this is not your WINC installation drive.

Version 0.01.039
================
(Released bu Howard on 2 March 1998)
Uses: Platform 003 releases: apparc=077 bafl=077 bitgdi=060 e32=121 e32tools=083 eiktools=122 eikon=216 f32=090 fbserv=074 fntstore=044 fonts=077
gdi=056 oplr=048 store=046 wserv=093

This release is the same as 038 apart from a new WINC translator tool to translate text files on the PC (courtesy of Rick Andrews).
If you have a WINC environment you can get the new components as follows:

cd \Epoc32\Tools
pkunzip -o r:\oplt\zip\opltranb.039
cd \Epoc32\release\winc\deb
pkunzip -o r:\oplt\zip\opltran.039

NB. Edit \epoc32\tools\opltran.bat to set _opltDrv to your WINC installation drive.

The command-line for opltran.bat is:
opltran opl-filename [-iinclude-path] [-ooutput-path] [-s]
where opl-filename should include the full path of the source filename. All paths must be fully qualified including drive letter.
The -s option produces symbolic debugging information in the OPO or APP file, as well as a .SYM files providing the symbol tables.

MNT VALID not required - old components released unchanged.
