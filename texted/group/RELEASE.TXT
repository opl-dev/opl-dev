================
(Made by Kevin Dempsey, May 1997)

Uses Eikon 188,Oplr 043,Oplt 034 (for common headers only),

Wins, release and debug

file only)

Wins, release and debug
Marm, release and debug

Intermediate release to use Oplt 030, the runtime needs rebuilding to
use this version of the translator

1) Loads OPLT at start up rather than statically linking so that the
translator can be replaced with one in ram. This assumes that the
first export of and OPLT.DLL returns a fully constructed
COplTranslatorBase derived object, leaving otherwise. The object
should NOT be on the cleanup stack


Version 0.06.036
================
(Made by Kevin Dempsey, April 1997)

Uses Eikon 178, Oplt 029, Oplr 039(for common header and resource
file only)

Wins, release and debug
Marm, release and debug

1) Print setup is now saved to the document file so that headers and
footers are not lost. This is saved to a separate stream and if this
stream doesn't exist the default print setup is used (hence old OplEdit
files will still work)

2) Now uses the undo facilities provided by Eikon edwins. Hence added
Ctrl+Z as a hot key and the resource

MENU_ITEM
	{
	command=EEikCmdEditUndo;
	txt="Undo delete";
	flags=EEikMenuItemSeparatorAfter;
	},

to the top of the edit menu.

file only)

Wins, release and debug
Marm, release and debug

visibility are saved to the ini file on exit and restored on starting

2) Apps can no longer be run using the "Run program" command and the
dialog is restricted to showing only OPOs. Apps can still be run
immediately after translation.

3) Save is now dimmed on the menu when the file is unchanged

4) Added the resource 

    RESOURCE TBUF r_txed_file_unchanged { buf="File has not changed"; }

5) When a running program exits the RThread that was used to logon to
the runtime is now closed


Version 0.06.034
================
(Made by Kevin Dempsey, April 1997)

Uses Eikon 175, Oplt 026, Oplr 037(for common header and resource
file only)

Marm, release build only

1) When the translator finds an error in an INCLUDE'd file the user
is asked if they want to open the file. If they do the file is opened
and the cursor is positioned to the error

2) When INCLUDE'd files are specified without a path the file is
searched for first in the root source file's directory and then in
\system\opl\ on all disks

3) Added print setup to the prining cascade as per the style guide

4) Other changes to the resource file as requested by Terry


Version 0.06.032

Uses Eikon 167, Oplt 021 , Oplr 033(for common header and resource
file only)

Wins, release and debug
Marm, release build only

Upgraded to the above components

1) Fixed bugs SW-985,SW-1196
2) Changes made to print range dialog
    - NB changing the print device can cause the preview to fail
          (the number of pages changing seems to be the cause)

Uses Eikon 165, Oplt 020, Oplr 032(for common header and resource
file only), PrintDrv 029

file only), PrintDrv 027

Wins, release and debug
Marm, release build only

1) Translation is no longer cancelled by pressing enter (bug SW-743)
2) Passes window group identifier to the runtime so texted is
    returned to when the runtime exits

Changes made by Vamsi:
1) As required by new printing design in Eikon

Changes made by Howard:
1) Apparc's OpenNewDocumentL() now needs extra args (see APPARC 034
   release notes)
   CStreamDictionary*& and fileMode.
   Declared a temporary dictionary and just deleted it in both calls.
   Used EFileShareExclusive›EFileWrite
2) ExportAsTextL() now needs a line-wrap arg
   Uses new const KExportLineWrap=512 (is that a reasonbale value?)
3) Gets E32Utils
4) Now supports runtime error location
   (Still todo: needs a new message instead of dialog "Translating...", 
   maybe "Locating error..." InfoMsg or new dialog class)

Changes made by Kevin:
1) Preferences now saved to ini file
2) Goto implemented
	- presents a list of the proc's in the file
	- jumps to the proc selected
3) Added show toolbar menu item
4) Fixed handling of the global editors paginate flags
5) The output file name is saved and is used to seed the run file
	dialog (NB if there is a output name (ie. the current file has
	been translated) then the dialog is NOT restricted to any Uid)
6) Looks for the opl debugger DLL and if found a "translate for debugger"
	menu item is available
7) Translation is now done by an idle object and can be cancelled
	- also means the redraws while translation can occur
8) While running the editor is switched to a read only mode
	- navigation and text selection is still possible
		- hence, copy to cliboard and ir send are possible
	- menu items that would change files or the editor's state are disallowed
9) Menu items that are not allowed are dimmed and suitable infomsg's are
	displayed if these items are selected
10) Changed the auto-indent code to ignore Ctrl-Enter and Ctrl-M 
	- fixes bug SW-39 (B4 problems)
11) Shift-Enter inserts a paragraph break rather than a line break
	- this means the translator doesn't need two line terminating chars
	- see problem SW-91 (B4 problems)
12) Added Export as text menu item
13) If an opl runtime error occurs the error text is stored and can be
	displayed using "Show last error" menu item
******	- the same will be the case for translator errors
14) Current file is no longer saved when launching Open/New file dialogs
	- saving is done just before opening or creating the file
15) Small menu layout changes and ellipses added as appropriate
16) Loads oplr resource file as startup as this contains the translator error
     messages


Version 0.04.023
================

Wins, release and debug
Marm, release build only
Sizes:	wins debug 	46592
	wins release	25088
	arm release	17940 (size on pc)

1) Preferences now work, ie. show tabs,spaces etc. 
2) Menu tidied, and hot-keys rationalized
3) Run File menu item launches a file selection dialog seeded to the current files expected output

Version 0.01.019
================
(Made by Kevin Dempsey,  Nov 1996)
Uses:	Eikon 123 OplT 009

B3 release
MARM sizes:
TEXTED.APP		13048
TEXTED.ICN		1293
TEXTED.RSC		1835

Only changes are in the resource file.
Prog pane added to the menu and Translate replaces Tab on the toolbar


Version 0.01.018
================
(Made by Howard Price,  Nov 1996)

Uses:	Eikon 120, Oplt 009

B3 test release
MARM sizes:
TEXTED.APP		11532
TEXTED.ICN		1301
TEXTED.RSC		1757

Note: Texted translates OPL programs ok (Control+Shift+T) but fails with KERN-EXEC 3 when you try to run it.
After translation, you will therefore need to go to the Shell to run the program.


Version 0.01.017
================
(Made by Kevin Dempsey,  Oct 1996)

Uses:   EIKON 108 (other dependencies as for EIKON 108), OPLT 008

ARM sizes:
APP	11580
ICN	1301
RSC	1757

"Standard set" of variants: WINS Ascii/Release and GCC Release

1) Now uses the document handling of AppArc so that the shell will handle the files created correctly

2) Fixed bug where if the text filled more than one segment in the buffer the translation failed

3) When translating the current main document file name is used to generate the output name, so there is no longer the need to save the file before translating.

4) Hot-key Shift-control-t to translate.

Still to do:
1) File saving on exit (or changing files) if the file has changed
2) Some menu items (eg. New file,Revert to saved etc.) need implementing
3) Maybe changing to translating using an idle object so that the translation can be cancelled - will have to see how fast the translations are to decide if this is important.

 (now dialogs are responsible).

4)Added EIXFONTDD.* files (font dialog) in the TextEd for testing purpose.

Coming soon
-----------
Implement Print dialogs.


Version 0.01.004
================
(Made by Vamsi Kamineni,  April 1996)

Uses:   EIKON 050 (other dependencies as for EIKON 050)

Debug variant only released

1) Few changes to Find Dialog.

2) Implemented Replace dialog.  Both Find and Replace dialogs use combo boxes.

3) Set the flag "EEikEdwinCreateOwnFormats" in CTextEdAppControl to improve the display of the line cursor


Version 0.01.003
================
(Made by Vamsi Kamineni,  March 1996)

Uses:   EIKON 039 (other dependencies as for EIKON 039)

1)The header file has been changed in CTextEdModel.H (It is totally independent of eikon).

2)Rearranged code in all the files to follow the TextEd design.

3)Now TextEd stores the result of the dialogs (eg. tabs and wordwrap) in its profile file. 

4)Few changes in CTextEdAppControl.* files. 
A new function called HandleProfileChangedL() is implemented to update corresponding changes when profile is changed.  Set the flag "EEikEdwinInclusiveSizeFixed" in CTextEdAppControl to avoid vertical scrollbar overwriting part of the toolbar.

5) Created dummy dialog for spell check.

Coming soon
-----------
Fix minor bugs in Find and Vertical scrollbars.
Implement Print dialogs.


Version 0.01.002
================
(Made by DunkenS, 4 April 1996)

Uses:   EIKON 037 (other dependencies as for EIKON 037)

1) An interim release to allow eikon work to be tested.

2) Begun modularising the code a little.  The following headers are defined;
	TEDMODEL.H		- Defines the information model and the profile model
	TEAPPRFL.H		- The concrete CTextEdAppProfile class
	TEAPCTRL.H		- The concrete CTextEdAppControl class
	TEXTEDOC.H		- The concrete CTextEdDocument class and other miscellany
...there are source *.cpp files to match each of these headers.


Version 0.01.001
================
(Made by DavidW, 26 March 1996)

Uses:   EIKON 032 (other dependencies as for EIKON 032)

The first ever "standalone" release of TEXTED

The contents of this release is materially the same as the version of
TEXTED in EIKON 032.  However, TEXTED is now built in its own group,
has its own version number, gets PVCSed separately, and has its own
releaseables:

*) r:\texted\zip\ewins.<ver> contains TEXTED.PRG and TEXTED.PRD, the
Release mode and Debug mode "Eikon executables" respectively

*) r:\texted\zip\ewinsdb.<ver> contains TEXTED.PDB, the program
database file to help debugging through TEXTED source code

*) r:\texted\zip\resource.<ver> contains TEXTED.RSC, the application
resource file

(If you do a clean "GETBLD", don't forget you may need to copy
ESTORD.DLL from r:\eikon\temp into your \e32sys)
