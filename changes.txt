v1.56 16 June 06 ricka@users.sourceforge.net and arjenb@users.sourceforge.net

OPLT:
* arjenb: Added new graphics command gXBORDER32 - see OPLR

OPLR:
* arjenb: Fixed bug [1507068] Runtime with active menu freezes when focus switches 
* arjenb: New functionality to fix bug [1172574] gXBORDER only draws one border type
  gXBORDER32 command was added that draws the new Symbian ER6 style borders,
  addding OpCode::gXBorder32() and modifying CONST.TPH. See Developer note #1 below 
  for details.

NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS:
1. New graphics command: gXBORDER32
gXBORDER32 draws the new Symbian ER6 style borders. Since the new flag constants for these type
of borders exceed the size of an integer and the old gXBORDER command only accepts a integer flag,
the new command was introduced. The syntax of gXBORDER32 is almost identical to the old gXBORDER 
command, but the first parameter is no longer present and the second parameter has been changed to 
a longint.

Usage: gXBORDER32 flags&[,w%,h%]

Constants for the different border types are included in CONST.OPH.

The following example draws a Window-type border around the current drawable:
   gXBORDER32 KgXBorder32Window&

* arjenb: Fixed bug [1160930] SIS files are missing Series80ProductID
* arjenb: AppFrame.opx, SendAs.opx and System.opx are now included as files in the OPL runtime 
  installation and are no longer available as separate sis-files. This to prevent the user from
  seeing 4 installation warnings when installing the runtime and to prevent reinstallation 
  problems on Nokia 9300/9500 Communicators.

OPLT:
* arjenb: Fixed bug [911620] Stale .AIF files left in \System\Temp

  addding FuncOpCode::gPixel(). See Developer note #1 below for details.
* arjenb: Fixed bug and added new functionality for feature [1499213] LOC partially broken
  The LOC function was changed to use language independent case insensitive searching.
  Additionally, an optional 3rd argument for LOC was added, to allow specification of the 
  search mode (normal, folded and collapsed), adding FuncOpCode::LocWithCase() and modifying 
  const.tph. See Developer note #2 below for details.
* arjenb: Fixed bug [0934352] MPOPUP crashes.

GENERAL:
* ricka:  Fixed bug [1101203] HRH2OPH missing from Dev Pack
* ricka:  Got OPL building for Nokia 7710, formally known as Series 90. 
  Changed over to the 7710 SDK for WINS, rather than WINSCW version. !!TODO add warning about no FEP.
* ricka:  Added details of bugfixes to SDK build files, to build OPL. !!TODO /dev Is this meant to be released?	

NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS:
1. New graphics command: gPIXEL
gPIXEL returns the RGB color value of a pixel in the current drawable.

Usage: rgb&=gPIXEL(xpos%,ypos%)

RGB values are returned as longints and can be converted to red, green and blue values using the KRgbRedPosition&, 
KRgbGreenPosition&, KRgbBluePosition& and KRgbColorMask& constants (specified in CONST.OPH). 

The following example retrieves the RGB values of a horizontal line of 15 pixels starting at position 4,6 
in the specified window and prints the retrieved RGB values in the default window:

PROC GetPixelDemo:(DrawableID%)
LOCAL I%,P&,R&,G&,B&
  I% = 0
  WHILE I% < 15
    gUSE DrawableID%
    P& = gPIXEL(4+I%,6)
    R& = P& / KRgbRedPosition& AND KRgbColorMask&
    G& = P& / KRgbGreenPosition& AND KRgbColorMask&
    B& = P& / KRgbBluePosition& AND KRgbColorMask&
    gUSE 1
    PRINT "Pixel at (" + NUM$(4+I%,2) + ",6)= R:" + NUM$(R&,3) + ",G:" + NUM$(G&,3) + ",B:" + NUM$(B&,3)
    I%=I%+1
  ENDWH
ENDP

2. Changes to the LOC function
LOC is now implemented using a locale *independent* case insensitive search. The previous version of LOC
used a locale *dependent* case insensitive search. The problem with the locale dependent version was that
it did not find non-printable characters (like CHR$(0)), and incorrectly reported them as found at the first 
position of the string. It also mapped most extended characters to their collated counterparts before starting
the search (e.g. ß becomes S), which could lead to incorrect results.

The LOC function has also been extended with an optional third argument, allowing you to specify the search mode. 
LOC is now able to do a case sensitive search, a language dependent case insensitive search and a language 
independent case insensitive search. For this purpose three new constants have been added to CONST.OPH:
KLocFindExact%       does a case sensitive search
KLocFindCollated%    does a case insensitive search (locale dependent)
KLocFindFolded%      does a case insensitive search (locale independent), same effect as LOC with two arguments

In the event that your application relies on the fact that LOC uses the language dependent search (for example 
if your code expects that a ß-character is considered equal to an S or the degree symbol (°) is equal to 
the O-character), you need to use LOC's new optional third argument with the value KLocFindCollated%.

v1.54 11 January 05 ricka@users.sourceforge.net and phil.spencer@symbian.com

TEXTED:
* Minor corrections to libraries included in the mmp file.
* Corrected the HorizontalScrollBar state test for the Program menu.
* Minor change to UIQ Program menu separator bar for Edit pane.
* Removed Find from UIQ menu - bug [910920] Find doesn't work on UIQ editor.
* Started a solution for bug [1095527] Search and Replace doesn't work in TextEd
  on 9200 and 9500 phones.

---
v1.53 24 December 04 ricka@users.sourceforge.net and phil.spencer@symbian.com

GENERAL:
* Added an extra build flag __UIQ_MMP_WINS_TOO__ in opl-target.mmpi include file
  to re-instate some WINS support under UIQ.
* Fixed bug [911000] Files missing from UIQ dev pack.
  Const.oph and various .oxh files now present in the UIQ developer pack.
* Added new makeopl.bat file to rebuild all opl components from a single script.

OPLR:
* Fixed bug [922555] UIQ: dINIT Problems with Buttons
  Changed UIQ dialog RSS file to just contain an OK button by default, no need for
  full ALERT dialog keys on dialogs where no dBUTTONS is used.

* Fixed bug [908415] dButton Command - Four buttons as default on UIQ (p800)
  Changed dBUTTONS construction so that on UIQ (like on ER5) only used buttons are
  added, removing the problem of unsightly blank buttons which was a hangover from
  the Crystal CBA way of doing things.

* Fixed bug [851520] Unguarded RDebug::Print
  All calls to RDebug::Print() are now guarded for _DEBUG builds only.
  Note: this required changes to OPX mediaserveropx too.

* Added some S80_DP2_0 (Nokia 9300/9500)-specific changes for dDate's AddDateEditorL().

OPLTOOLS:
* Added HRH2OPH to help convert UIQ help compiler files to OPL include files.

OPX:
* Removed some of the unsupported configurable features of Appframe.OPX from the
  S80_SP2_0 (Nokia 9300/9500) version. e.g. Add To Desk, IR Listen.
  Ditto for System.OPX's access to system timers, ETEL and PLP remote link.

TEXTED:
* Changed some UIQ menus and dialogs to make it look and behave more like a UIQ
  application.

* Fixed bug [910311] No horizontal scrollbar in TextEd
  While the scroll bar should appear automatically, like the vertical scroll bar, 
  there seems to be some underlying problem which stops this happening. So the Editor
  menu now allows the choice of whether you want the horizontal scroll bar visible or
  not. It's off by default.
  Also, there's a (related?) problem with the width of the document - the scroll bar
  action gives the impression that the document is approx. 2000 chars wide! This is
  most obvious when dragging the scroll bar thumb, which means this action isn't very
  useful. However, tapping on the scroll bar arrow heads (or the bar between the
  thumb and the arrow head) works quite well. 
  (Incidently, this is not a UIQ problem, a test version of the Editor app built for
  the 9210 exhibits the same weird horizontal scroll bar too.)
  See the sourceforge bug report for more details.

* Fixed bug [980744] Missing print setup on phone stops editor
  Cleaned up the print setup problem first seen in the v0.50 release.
  The fix is to trap a leaving function (iEikonEnv->NewDefaultPrintSetupL()) and use
  null, as the editor is designed to handle this optional feature.

DEMOOPL:
* Partial fix for bug [1079304] "DemoOPL.mk modifies src folder" where the custom
  makefile was building the DemoIcon.mbm file incorrectly.

v1.52 19 June 04 ricka@users.sourceforge.net

OPLR:
* Partial solution for bug [910981] gFONT doesn't work on UIQ, picking up the 
  SwissA font in graphics windows for the beta release of OPL for UIQ.
  Added CONST KFontUiqSwissABeta&=&017B4B0D
* Corrected a build problem from the v1.51 for Series 60 OPL.APP, regarding
  included .mmpi files.
* Added details to the oplwrapper0 readme.txt file.
* Corrected some problems with opltest, the OPL test harness.
* Added tOpxVersionNumber.tpl which shows how to confirm your OPL app is using the 
  right OPX version.

General
* Changed the baseline of the source code to the CVS version - some minor differences
  in the cases of filenames - to improve CVS submissions.

---
v1.51 29 February 04 ricka@users.sourceforge.net

OPLTOOLS:
* Removed a couple of build warnings.

OPLR:
* Fixed a problem with profile menu pane on Nokia 9500. (In the Nokia 9500 beta SDK, 
  the location of ProfileAutoMenu.dll has moved, compared to Nokia 9200. The runtime
  now looks in both locations.)

OPX:
* Tidied up Celltrack OPX release.
* Fixed a bug in Crystal AppFrame OPX, introduced during UIQ integration.

TEXTED:
* Fixed a minor build problem with the Crystal build, introduced during UIQ
  integration.

DEMOOPL:
* Fixed the DemoOPL help build for Crystal, and added the help file back into the 
  .SIS file.

WEBSITE:
* Removed ALEPPO.ZIP - at 3MB, it's too big to be part of the src code zip file.

---
v1.50 22 February 04 ricka@users.sourceforge.net

OPLT:
* Minor changes to support multi-compiler build, and fix a CodeWarrior compiler
  warning. Now builds cleanly for both MS Dev and CW.

OPLTOOLS:
* There is no OPLTRAN for UIQ yet. OPLTRAN is a WINC tool, and WINC is not 
  supported on the UIQ SDK.
  The short-term solution is to use a version of OPLTRAN from another SDK 
  e.g. Nokia 9200. 

OPLR:
* Integrated Lar's UIQ changes for the runtime. Added support for multi-compiler
  build.
* For UIQ, OPLR supports the EQuartzKeyConfirm button (Jog Dial press) for menus.

OPX:
* Integrated Lar's changes to AppFrame, SendAs, System OPXs to support UIQ.
* Spell not available for UIQ (no lexicon libraries).
* Added CellTrack OPX (for CRYSTAL only initially).
* Minor changes for multi-compiler build.

TEXTED:
* Included Lar's changes for UIQ.

v1.30 27 November 03 ricka@users.sourceforge.net

OPLR:
* Further changes to cascade menus.
* Fixed priority key halt for Series 60 emulator, as a workround for
  OnStopping() not being called.
* Fixed defect 817867 "reset the default window" so the default OPL console is 
  full screen, with the screen furniture behind the OPL console.
* Fixed defect 844681 "OPO filename too long" by making the length for chars, 
  not bytes.

OPX:
* Released an alpha version on Contact OPX for testing with Series 60.
  No major changes to the source code, but the test code modified as Series 60
  only supports one contact db, and the original test code was better suited to
  the 9210's support for many databases.

---
v1.26a 5 October 03 ricka@users.sourceforge.net
(Not released externally)

OPLR:
* The runtime now derived from MCoeFepAwareTextEditor for FEP interaction.
  This means a new export for S60, #167.
* Also calls OfferKeyEvent() on the FEP
* Test version of GET, INPUT$ etc. Numberic mode only at the moment.
* Fixes to MENU for FEP.
  And KCommandIdOffset is 0x8000 to prevent interaction with 0x4000 used by FEP.
* Cleaned up a WINS CFrame dtor problem.
* Added a makezip.bat file for oplwrapper0 and updated its readme.txt file.
* Added menu test opl source to opltest\Series60\

---
v1.25 27 July 03 ricka@users.sourceforce.net

OPLR:
* Added the Series60 font ids to Const.tph file - see KFontS60...
  Added oplr\opltest\series60\gfontdemo61.tpl test code to exercise the consts.
* Using the default font id &9A now gives you Latin Plain 12 on Series 60 runtime.
  This fixes defect 735621.
* Adjusted the console window width to better fit a non-proportional font.
  Goes a long way to fixing 740298.
* Added oplr\oplwrapper0 - a canonical Series60 wrapper. Start with this version
  if you want to roll your own C++ app wrapper. See oplr\oplwrapper0\readme.txt.
  As it stands, Oplwrapper0 builds a C++ wrapper for OplTestS60, a test harness 
  which can be used to test .OPO files located in C:\OplTest\.
  See the OPL source code oplr\oplwrapper0\opltests60.tpl for more info.

OPX:
* Released an alpha version of AppFrame OPX to switch the status pane on/off.
  This fixes defect 745071.
  To use, call AfSetStatusVisible%:(0) for off, 1 for on.
  Note that no other OPX APIs have been tested.
* Added some mediaserveropx test code progs missing from earlier releases.

Other:
* Added set of 6.1 logs giving examples of good Series 60 builds. See \logs6.1.

---
v1.24 15 June 03 ricka@users.sourceforge.net

Added scripts for building the 9200 public (runtime) and developer packages.
Added copies of the build logs in \opl\logs\ for comparision purposes.

---
v1.23 26 May 03 ricka@users.sourceforge.net

OPLT: Improved OPLT casting - changes from Keita 
  http://www.hi-ho.ne.jp/~ktkawabe/densha_e.html
  See oplt\stran\ot_utl.cpp for more details.
* Added a new test to the OPLT test suite in ttran\.

---
v1.22 26 May 03 ricka@users.sourceforge.net

All components:
* Fix THUMB builds for building with Nokia 9200 Communicator Series 
  SDK v1.2.
  Basically adding new librarys to ensure that THUMB builds are
  complete with this SDK. 
  - egcclib with edll.lib and edllstub.lib

OPLT: 
* Build from relative location.
* Fixed the test suite so that it runs for 9210.
* Got tmodtran test working again.
* Export the test suite data to \c\topt\.
  (It was building for z:\data\).
* Added a makefile 'preptest.mk' to build the suite code.
* Corrected a couple of typo's while debugging the suite.

OPLR: 
* Added thumb build libs to oplr and recopl.

OPLTOOLS:
* Fixed bug 743653 "OPLTRAN can't handle relative filenames" in opltran.cpp
* Upped the version number to 2.09 accordingly.

OPX: 
* Got the OPX code building with a relative location.
* And using EPOCROOT.

Other minor changes:
* Removed some distribution.policy files.
* Changed the name of this src zip from 'opl-dev' to 'opl', matching the 
  sourceForge.net CVS details.

---
v1.21 05 May 03 ricka@users.sourceforge.net

OPLR: Added support for Series 60 phones on Symbian OS 6.1 
* Added conditional framework in .mmp files for .def, src and libs
* Major mods to opl runtime startup.
* Disabled FEP interaction for now.

Plus other minor source changes:
* Made oplt use a relative build, no longer has to be \oplt.
* Ditto for oplr.
* Removed distribution.policy files - we don't need them any longer.
* Removed monochrome oplr\aif icons.
* Renamed colour oplr\aifc icon folder to oplr\aif.
* Removed some old stuff from oplr\group.
* Renamed oplr\aif\opl.rss to oplaif.rss - or we'd have two version of opl.rss.
* Moved Symbian OS 6.0-only versions into <name>60 subdirs:
    inc60 - dummy bldvariant.hrh file. Keeps 6.0 builds happy.
    opl60 - 6.0 version of opl.app. I was having major problems with __SERIES60_
      definitions in resource files (and this was panicking the S60 emulator
      at startup!), so I split the subdir in two. :-(
* Added a readme.txt file

Note: this is only a half-way house and not suitable for porting to new
versions of the OS. We need to do something like move the core OPL functions
to some new core library, and get each OPL UI to link to the core.

---
v1.20 23 April 03

Initial upload of OPL for SourceForge.net
