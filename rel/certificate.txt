All SIS files in the v1.55 release of the OPL runtime for the Nokia Communicator are now signed with a self signed
certificate. This means that you will still receive a warning that the supplier cannot be verified when you install
any of the SIS files in the package, but instead of the question mark you will see the name "OPL developer team" as
the supplier of the SIS file.

Since everybody can make a self signed certificate with this name, you can check whether or not the SIS file you are
installing is valid by clicking the "Details" button in the installation dialog and checking the presented information
against the information below. If the information is the same, you can be pretty sure that this SIS file was created
by the OPL development team and is safe to install on your device.
