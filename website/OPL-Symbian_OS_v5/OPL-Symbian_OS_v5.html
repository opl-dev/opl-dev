      <p><b>DBMS - OPL's database features in-depth </b><br>
        OPL is a language that has always placed great importance on its database 
        functionality. OPL uses Symbian OS DBMS; a relational database management 
        system which supports SQL (the Standard Query Language). <br>

      <p><b>Tutorial: Writing Multi-lingual OPL Applications</b> <br>
        With Symbian OS and OPL, creating multi-lingual applications has never 
        been easier. The process is founded on the basic principle that parts 
        of your application which differ between languages should be kept separate 
        from the actual application code.<br>

      <p><b>Extending OPL with C++ - OPXs</b><br>
        OPXs are extensions to the OPL programming language, written in C++, 
        which may be used by OPL programmers to access system facilities not otherwise 
        directly available from OPL. <br>

      <p><b>Extending OPL with OPL - OPMs</b><br>
        OPMs are extensions to the OPL programming language, pre-written in OPL.
        OPMs are written to save the developer time developing and testing commonly 
        used routines, to save memory by providing shared code for OPL developers, 
        and to aid rapid development of applications. <br>

      <p><b>OPMs - Writing OPL Modules </b><br>
        The Symbian Developer Network encourage developers to write their own 
        OPMs and allow other members of the OPL community to use them. To help 
        their wide acceptance some standards have been written which should be 
        adhered to where possible. <br>

      <p><b>OPL Reference Database in Symbian OS Help format</b><br>
        Version 1.0 of the OPL Reference Database (Version 1.0) in 
        symbian OS Help format. Included are descriptions of (most) OPL commands plus 
        the built in OPX commands. (Suitable for devices based on Symbian OS v3 
        and v5.)<br>
