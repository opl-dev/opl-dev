<p><font color="#006699"><b>Summary:</b></font> With Symbian OS and OPL, creating multi-lingual 
  applications has never been easier. The process is founded on the basic principle 
  that parts of your application which differ between languages should be kept 
  separate from the actual application code. This includes text, graphics and 
  keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<h2><a name="oplrsc_mm-001"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
<p> Differences between language variants (or locales as they are officially titled) 
  of applications can be broadly classified into two areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Things that the user can see (strings of text, bitmaps, etc.)</li>
  <li> Things the user can do (by pressing certain hotkeys for example)</li>
</ul>
<p>The requirement of different bitmaps between locales can be easily dealt with 
  in OPL by using the Symbian OS native multi-bitmap file format (MBM), where the 
  underlying bitmaps can be changed without requiring a re-translation of the 
  application. Language resource files provide a similar feature for text strings.</p>
<p>When writing an application that is to be translated into different languages, 
  careful thought should be given to all parts which could differ between languages. 
  These may include any or all of the following examples (and maybe other things 
  too, depending on your application):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The names of menu options</li>
  <li> Hotkeys for those options (for example, on UK machines the &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Close</font>&#146; 
    action is always <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Ctrl+E</font>. 
    On French machines it is <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Ctrl+Q</font>)</li>
  <li> Text/numbers displayed in dialogs</li>
  <li> Text/numbers displayed on screen as part of the current view</li>
  <li> Error messages</li>
  <li> Toolbar button captions</li>
  <li> The name of your application as reported in the &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Open 
    files/programs</font>&#146; dialog</li>
</ul>
<p>The system of using resource files which contain the relevant details for each 
  language provides an easy way to take care of everything. This document explains 
  how to create and use such files in several easy steps, as well as how to access 
  the existing resource files on the ROM of an Symbian OS device which are used by the 
  built in applications.</p>

      More details below.</td>

<h2> <a name="oplrsc_mm-003"></a>3. The Basics</h2>
<p>The first step is to get ready to build your project. All of the resource related 
  tools (with the exception of <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">ConvRSG</font> 
  and <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">EIKON.oph</font>) are PC 
  based, so the most efficient way to develop and test resource files, at least 
  in the beginning, is to use WINS as supplied with your SDK. <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">ConvRSG</font> 
  is a tool which will be explained in more detail - it is written in OPL and 
  must be run from WINS or on a real Symbian OS machine. The <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">EIKON.oph</font> 
  include file can be also used on either WINS or an Symbian OS machine).</p>
<p>When you create an OPL application, you can keep your source code in any folder 
  you like. After you have translated your code, all of the output files will 
  be placed in the path <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">&lt;Code 
  Drive&gt;:\System\Apps\CodeFileName\CodeFileName.app</font>. Since your finished 
  application will be loading resource files from a similar folder, this is where 
  the tools will output the compiled files.</p>
<p>The first file you need to install is <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">EIKRSS.bat</font>. 
  This is a modified version of &#145;EIKRS.bat&#146; which is supplied with the 
  Symbian OS v5 SDK. This new file should be placed in <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">x:\epoc32\tools\</font> 
  - where <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">x:</font> is the letter 
  of the drive on which your SDK is installed. This means it can be accessed from 
  anywhere (provided you did not remove the PATH to this folder which the SDK 
  installation created).</p>
<p>Secondly, it would be a wise idea to install the sample program, <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp</font>, 
  provided with this document. This illustrates all the concepts covered here, 
  and is clearly commented. Instructions for the installation can be found in 
  the file &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp.txt</font>&#146; 
  (inside the &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp 
  Program.zip</font>&#146; archive). From now on, this document will assume you 
  have installed <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp</font> 
  as per the instructions, and the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp</font> 
  program and folder locations will be used as a basis for examples in this document.</p>
<p>The <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">EIKON.oph</font> file 
  should be placed in <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">\System\OPL\</font> 
  on any drive (of either WINS or an Symbian OS device), so that it can be included 
  in any OPL program with a simple statement of <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">INCLUDE 
  &quot;EIKON.OPH&quot;</font>.</p>
<p>The final file which needs attention at this stage is &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Make 
  RSCExamp.bat</font>&#146;. This is a batch file written specifically to automate 
  the compilation of all the current RSCExamp resources. It should be placed in 
  the same folder as the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp</font> 
  source code (e.g. as the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp</font> 
  instructions suggest, <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">c:\RSCExamp\</font> 
  on the emulator (it is not needed when working on a real Symbian OS device as batch 
  files are a feature of the Windows Operating System). Be sure to check that 
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExa*.rss</font> also exist 
  in this folder, or the batch file will not work correctly. Once you are ready 
  to create your own resource files, you can use this <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">.BAT</font> 
  as a basis or template for one which will build all of your own resources.</p>
<table width="90%" border="2" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
  <tr> 
    <td><font class="note"><b>Note:</b> &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Make 
      RSCExamp.bat</font>&#146; assumes that your SDK is installed on drive <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">c:\</font> 
      of your PC. If this is not the case, please edit the file and alter the 
      line near the top which reads &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">SET 
      _SDK_ROOT=c:\epoc32</font>&#146; to &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">SET 
      _SDK_ROOT=x:\epoc32</font>&#146; where <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">x:</font> 
      is the drive on which your SDK is installed.</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>To create your own resource files, you will have to write the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">.RSS</font> 
  source file. Each source file will vary greatly between different applications, 
  both in content and layout, hence it is difficult to illustrate how to write 
  the one you will need. However, a useful example is the program supplied with 
  this document, <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp</font>. 
  This is clearly commented, and should serve to illustrate all the fundamental 
  concepts required for writing <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">.RSS</font> 
  files. You could also use it as a basis for your own files if you become stuck.</p>
<p>If you are worried that the layout of <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">.RSS</font> 
  files looks confusing, and the whole process seems to be a lot of extra work, 
  then don&#146;t! To address the first issue, it only looks confusing because 
  it is new - once you have adjusted to the principles involved, you will find 
  that working with resource files becomes second nature to you. And to address 
  the second point, it probably is more work initially to get a resource file 
  written and working. However, the end result is worth it. If you are not convinced, 
  run the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp</font> program 
  and see how quick and easy it is to change languages at the touch of a button 
  &#150; and this occurs throughout the entire program too. Add to this the fact 
  that all language dependent text is included in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">.RSS</font> 
  file, making life easy for translators, and you have a very powerful and useful 
  format. All it requires is a little groundwork.</p>
<h2> <a name="oplrsc_mm-004"></a>4. Compiling resource files</h2>
<p>Once the resource script is written you will need to compile it. This is done 
  using the tools supplied with the OPL SDK. To stick with our example program, 
  RSCExamp, bring up a command prompt in Windows and change directory to the folder 
  where you installed the source code under the emulator (e.g. \epoc32\wins\c\RSCExamp\). 
  To compile an individual resource, you would simply type:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>EIKRSS RSCExamp UK rel</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at this more closely, the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">EIKRSS</font> 
  part will call the batch file supplied with this document which will invoke 
  the compiler, etc. to do the work for you. <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp</font> 
  is the name of the resource script (<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp.rss</font> 
  in this case) &#150; note that it is important that the file name is supplied 
  without the extension. The third part, UK, is probably the most important. This 
  tells the compiler what the target language of the resource file will be. Also 
  note, that language codes <b>must</b> be in upper case.</p>
<p>When writing the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">.RSS</font> 
  file, it is entirely possible for you to include lines which differentiate between 
  one or more potential languages as the file is being compiled, for example:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <pre>#ifdef LANGUAGE_UK
	RESOURCE TBUF text_colour {buf=&quot;Colour&quot;;}
	RESOURCE TBUF text_colour_grey {buf=&quot;Grey&quot;;}
#else
	RESOURCE TBUF text_colour {buf=&quot;Color&quot;;}
	RESOURCE TBUF text_colour_grey {buf=&quot;Gray&quot;;}
#endif</pre>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You will find a couple of examples of this technique within the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp.rss</font> 
  file. However, it should be noted that this method is really only suitable for 
  languages which differ slightly. UK and US English variants are the prime example, 
  as shown above and also with <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp.rss</font>.</p>
<p>If the languages differ vastly (e.g. English and French), then it is more advisable 
  to create a separate <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">.RSS</font> 
  file for each. Again, <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp</font> 
  illustrates this by having <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp.rss</font> 
  for the UK and US English languages, <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExaFR.rss</font> 
  for the French and <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExaGE.rss</font> 
  for the German. The actual names of these files do not matter, so long as the 
  correct argument is passed when you use <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">EIKRSS.bat</font> 
  &#150; the French resource file could be called &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Madness.rss</font>&#146; 
  so long as you called &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">EIKRSS.bat 
  Madness FR rel</font>&#146;! However, more meaningful names will obviously be 
  helpful to you later on when you want to decide which resource scripts belong 
  to which program, etc.</p>
<p>Although inadvisable, should you decide to do all language variants inside 
  just one <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">.RSS</font> file, 
  then you can put multiple <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RESOURCE 
  TBUF</font> lines within the<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2"> 
  #ifdef</font> to save time and space, and group all the languages together. 
  This is, again, illustrated in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp.rss</font> 
  file (near the start).</p>
<p>To obtain the complete set of compiled resources for <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp</font>, 
  you can either compile them individually like this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>EIKRSS RSCExamp UK rel
EIKRSS RSCExamp US rel
EIKRSS RSCExaFR FR rel
EIKRSS RSCExaGE GE rel</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>or, of course, you can simply run the &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Make 
  RSCExamp.bat</font>&#146; file, as this does all of these for you and tidies 
  up afterwards too.</p>
<p>For reference, the language codes used by the resource compiler are the same 
  as those accepted by Makesis when writing PKG script files. For more details, 
  see the Makesis instructions (&#145;Preparing applications for installation&#146;) 
  in the SDK.</p>
<p>The final part of the call to EIKRSS (rel) is not really important to OPL programmers. 
  The resource tools which ship on the OPL SDK are the same ones which ship on 
  the C++ SDK. This flag allows C++ developers to note whether the resource file 
  should be compiled for use in a debug, release, Unicode, etc. environment. As 
  far as OPL applications go, you will be safe to always call EIKRSS with the 
  &#145;rel&#146; (for &#145;release&#146;) flag.</p>
<h2> <a name="oplrsc_mm-005"></a>5. The Output Files</h2>
<p>After EIKRSS has finished, some new files will have been produced &#150; these 
  are the actual resource files. If you used &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Make 
  RSCExamp.bat</font>&#146;, you would end up with:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>\epoc32\wins\c\System\Apps\RSCExamp\RSCExamp.rUK
\epoc32\wins\c\System\Apps\RSCExamp\RSCExamp.rUS
\epoc32\wins\c\System\Apps\RSCExamp\RSCExamp.rGE
\epoc32\wins\c\System\Apps\RSCExamp\RSCExamp.rFR
\epoc32\wins\c\System\Apps\RSCExamp\RSCExamp.rSG</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The folder tree of<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2"> \epoc32\wins\c\System\Apps\&lt;RSCName&gt;\</font> 
  is the default output folder for the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">EIKRSS.bat</font> 
  file. If this does not exist, then <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">\epoc32\wins\c\System\Apps\</font> 
  will be used. However, &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Make 
  RSCExamp.bat</font>&#146; includes a command which will create <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2"><br>
  \epoc32\wins\c\System\Apps\RSCExamp\</font> if it does not exist, so if you 
  used &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Make RSCExamp.bat</font>&#146;, 
  that is always where the above files will be located.</p>
<p>The reason for this is so that when you switch back to the emulator to retranslate 
  or use your application, the resource files are immediately in the correct place 
  for it to &#145;see&#146; them.</p>
<table border="2" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" width="100%">
  <tr> 
    <td><font class="note"><b>Note:</b> The original <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">EIKRS.BAT</font> 
      file as supplied with the Symbian OS v5 SDK outputs files to <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">\epoc32\release\wins\deb\z\system\data\</font>.</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The only file listed above which is of any note at this point is the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">.RSG</font> 
  file. This is a list of the resource &#145;variables&#146; and their values. 
  This file needs converting into an OPL include file so that you can translate 
  your application with it using the standard <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">INCLUDE</font> 
  command. To do this conversion, you will need to use the small '<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">ConvRSG</font>' 
  program supplied with this document. When run, <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">ConvRSG</font> 
  will create an OSG file in the same folder as the RSG file (on the emulator 
  or your Symbian OS machine). This OSG file will be an Symbian OS OPL (&#145;Program&#146;) 
  document, and all the original <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">#define</font> 
  statements which appear in the RSG will have been replaced by standard OPL <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">CONST</font> 
  statements instead.</p>
<p>In your application code, all you need to do is include the OSG file at the 
  top of the code, as you do for (for example) an OPX. The OSG file should be 
  placed in the same folder as your main code file or in <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">\System\OPL\</font> 
  so that the translator can find it when you use the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">INCLUDE</font> 
  statement.</p>
<p>At this point, it is worth pointing out that the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp</font> 
  program is slightly nonstandard in the way it handles its resource files. The 
  whole point of <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp</font> 
  is to load a resource and then let you change that to a different one &#145;on 
  the fly&#146; - for example, it defaults to loading the UK English resource, 
  but you can change the entire language and operation of the program into French 
  by just altering which resource is loaded using the appropriate menu option. 
  The purpose of this is to demonstrate how easy resource files make the creation 
  of multi-lingual applications.</p>
<p>To facilitate this, RSCExamp expects a default resource file called <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp.rUK</font>, 
  and it also looks for the existence of several other resources (<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp.rUS</font>, 
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp.rFR</font> and <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp.rGE</font>) 
  in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">\System\Apps\RSCExamp\ 
  folder</font>.</p>
<p>Most &#145;normal&#146; applications expect to find a default resource file 
  called <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">AppName.rsc</font> (where 
  AppName is the name of the application) in their <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">\System\Apps\AppName\</font> 
  folder, and they do not expect or check for the existence of other resource 
  files as <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp</font> does.</p>
<p>This situation can be neatly handled by the Symbian OS Installer technologies, which 
  allow you to specify multiple files for different languages inside your SIS 
  file. When the user installs the application, only the relevant files for the 
  language they select are installed, the others are discarded.</p>
<p>If <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">RSCExamp</font> were a 
  &#145;normal&#146; application, this PKG file (script file for <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Makesis</font> 
  - see the SDK for more details) illustrates how things would be installed:</p>

<h2> <a name="oplrsc_mm-006"></a>6. Using the Resource File in your Application</h2>
<p>To use the new file within your application when it is running, you must first 
  load it into memory. This has to be done using the &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">LoadRSC&amp;:</font>&#146; 
  command from <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">SYSTEM.OPX</font>, 
  e.g.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>RSCId&amp;=LoadRSC&amp;:(&quot;c:\System\Apps\RSCExamp\RSCExamp.rUK&quot;)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To recall the variables from the file, simply use the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">SYSTEM.OPX</font> 
  command, <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">ReadRSC$:</font>, 
  e.g.:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>ReadRSC$:(TEXT_COLOUR&amp;)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This returns a string which you labeled &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Text_Colour</font>' 
  within the original <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">.RSS</font> 
  file (see above). As always, RSCExamp is the best place to refer to a working 
  situation of loading and reading from resource files.</p>
<p>It is important to note that every resource file (provided it is compiled with 
  its own 4 letter &#145;NAME&#146; variable as illustrated in the RSCExamp files) 
  is unique. The data held in it also has unique identifiers. This means it is 
  possible to use more than one resource file at a time. Simply load the files 
  you wish to use, and ReadRSC$: will work out on its own inside which file the 
  resource you want is, once you supply it the value from the INCLUDE file.</p>
<h2> <a name="oplrsc_mm-007"></a>7. Using Resource Files on the ROM</h2>
<p>Just as it is possible to use the contents of a resource file you have written 
  yourself from RAM, it is also possible to use the contents of the standard resource 
  files supplied in the ROM. For example, this OPL program will show how to obtain 
  the locale value for the text &#145;Busy&#146; for the current machine:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>INCLUDE &quot;SYSTEM.OXH&quot;</pre>
  <pre>CONST KSRBusy&amp;=&amp;F3B184</pre>
  <pre>PROC Main:
	LOCAL RSCId&amp;
	RSCId&amp;=LoadRSC&amp;:(&quot;Z:\System\Data\Eiksrv.rsc&quot;)
	PRINT ReadRSC$:(KSRBusy&amp;)
	GET
ENDP</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be applied to any of the resource files and using different numbers 
  you can experiment to find the different resources. However, also be aware that 
  it is not necessary to load the above &#145;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Eiksrv.rsc</font>&#146; 
  file from your OPL program. The reason being that this file is automatically 
  loaded by every OPL program when it is run. Thus it is possible to simply execute 
  the following code:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>INCLUDE &quot;SYSTEM.OXH&quot;</pre>
  <pre>CONST KSRBusy&amp;=&amp;F3B184</pre>
  <pre>PROC Main:
	PRINT ReadRSC$:(KSRBusy&amp;)
	GET
ENDP</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To further facilitate the use of the standard System resources, you can use 
  the OPL include file supplied with this document. Simply add the line <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">INCLUDE 
  &quot;EIKON.OPH&quot;</font> at the top of your code (assuming you placed the 
  file in <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">\System\OPL\</font> 
  as explained above), and all of the resources will be available to you via easy 
  to use CONST values.</p>
<h2> <a name="oplrsc_mm-008"></a>8. A Note About Long Integer Resources</h2>
<p>The resource files used throughout this tutorial only make use of string values. 
  This is mainly for reasons of simplicity. However, it is worth noting that OPL 
  is also able to access long integer values from resource files. In the RSCExamp 
  program where integers are needed (for example in some of the menu hotkeys), 
  they have been coded as strings in the resource file and are then converted 
  from a string to an integer using OPL&#146;s VAL function. If you used this 
  approach frequently, a small procedure would be advisable to help automate it, 
  e.g.:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>PROC RRL&amp;:(aResourceID&amp;)
	RETURN INT(VAL(ReadRSC$:(aResourceID&amp;)))
ENDP</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you wish to use long integers directly you should define a new STRUCT at 
  the top of your resource file, e.g.:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>// Define new KEY structure
STRUCT KEY
	{
	LONG key;
	}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Further down the resource file you can then define resource to use this structure 
  as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>RESOURCE KEY Resource_Name {key = 12;}
 </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To gain access to this resource from your OPL program you need to use ReadRSCLong&amp;: 
  function in SYSTEM.OPX, i.e.:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>PRINT ReadRSCLong&amp;:(RESOURCE_NAME&amp;)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>would cause the value 12 to be printed based on the above declaration.</p>
