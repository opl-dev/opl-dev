<p>An OPX is a Symbian OS DLL containing functions written in C++ but exposed 
  to the OPL developer via a special interface. This mechanism gives OPL 
  access to the full capabilities of the underlying Symbian OS operating system, 
  meaning that the language can be extended as required. The procedures 
  are as efficient as the built in OPL commands.</p>
<p>To develop OPXs, you need the C++ Software Development Kit. 
  OPXs are usually supplied within '.sis' installation files ready for installation 
  into the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">\System\OPX\</font> 
  directory (on <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">C:</font> or 
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">D:</font>) of the Symbian OS 
  machine.&nbsp; Separate versions are required for the Symbian OS machine 
  and the Symbian OS Emulator.</p>

      <p >The OPXs listed below 
        have been developed and released by the Symbian Developer Network.</p>
      <p>Suitable 
        for devices based on Symbian OS v3 and v5.</p>

          Symbian OS v5 devices, but Symbian OS v5 authors are encouraged to use 
          Agenda2.opx instead. This OPX is maintained only for older Symbian OS 
          v3 applications which made use of it before Agenda2 was written. <br>
