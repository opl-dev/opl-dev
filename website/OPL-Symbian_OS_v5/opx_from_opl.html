<p>An OPX&nbsp;procedure behaves like an OPL language keyword and looks like a 
  user defined OPL procedure. For example:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">IsReadOnly&amp;:(file$)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an OPX procedure from the System OPX which is present in the ER5 device's 
  ROM. The procedure takes a file name as a string argument, <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">file$</font>, 
  and returns a long integer, as specified by the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">&amp;</font>. 
  This long integer would be -1 if the file specified is read only or 0 if it 
  isn't.</p>
<p>To use this procedure you would need to include System OPX's header file at 
  the very top of your OPL program, as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">INCLUDE &quot;system.oxh&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all the knowledge that is needed to use OPX procedures.</p>
<p>There are many OPX procedures in the four 
  different OPXs which can be found in a Symbian OS v5 device's ROM. All of these 
  procedures have been documented in the SDK 
  in the same manner as OPL language keywords.</p>
<p>The OXH (header) files are Symbian OS text files which can be written in the Series 
  5 Program Editor. The System.oxh 
  header file contains approximately 80 definitions. If you wished to use only 
  the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">ISREADONLY&amp;:(file$)</font> 
  procedure then you could write an alternative header file like this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>DECLARE OPX SYSTEM,&amp;1000025C,$100
   IsReadOnly&amp;:(file$) : 17
END DECLARE</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You could even just type this code into the top of your OPL program.</p>
<p>Not using the standard header file, System.oxh, would merely save time during 
  translation.</p>
<p>&amp;1000025c is the OPX's unique id and $100 is the OPX's version number.</p>
<p>The number 17 is an ordinal which is necessary in locating this procedure in 
  the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">System.opx</font> &nbsp;DLL. 
  The name of the procedure is not important but the &amp; and file$ are important 
  as these tell the OPL translator which data types are passed and returned.</p>
